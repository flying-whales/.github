## Game Controls

The controls for the game are:

A - Dynamic mode. In this mode the whales will randomly gather points, and slowly regenerate lost health point. This mode is high risk high reward- the more you spend time in this mode the more points you will have, but you have to be quicker in reacting to incoming danger.

S - Track mode. In this mode the whales are commanded to follow your cursor. Use this mode to reposition the whales and to avoid danger.

D- Attack mode. In this mode the whales are stationary until you press left click with your mouse, thats when they will dash to that location. Each whale you have deals damage individually, so when your pack grows larger not only its easier to survive but you also deal more damage.  

Tip- When attacking enemies don't aim at them, aim behind them, That way when the dash is complete the whales are further away from the danger.

Shield and Whale summon skills when available:

Q- Shield, When off cooldown you can press Q to summon an invincible shield for a few seconds. The shield also deals damage to enemies! Decide for yourself whether you prefer to use it as an attacking tool or as a defensive tool.

W- Whale summon. The whales call for help and summon an additional whale. Use this whenever possible! The more whales you have the stronger you are.
